# Dotfiles

My dotfiles, managed with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/)

## Dependencies

Install using the relevant package manager or straight from source.

-   git
-   zsh

## Usage

1. Fork nad clone this repo
2. Run `./install` to automatically set up environment (idempotent so can safely be run multiple times).

## Configuration

-   You can customize programs directly in the eponymous folders
-   Don't forget to update [install.conf.yaml](install.conf.yaml) accordingly when adding new customizations
